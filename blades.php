		Like Chinese rubbers, their blades were traditionally hard, heavy, and fast.  But in response to the demands of the West, as well as changing styles in the East, they're starting to make blades out of lighter, softer woods.  Often a Chinese blade will be sold for half the price of the same blade made in the same factory in China but stamped for a European or Japanese company.
		<br /><br />
		As a general rule carbon will make a blade faster and stiffer, and more consistent through the blade face.  It also adds a somewhat annoying "pink" tone to your shots.  Other composites like arylate, glassfiber, and Kevlar don't stiffen or speed up the blade as much, and they feel softer.  They also enlarge the "sweet spot" while dampening the feel of the blade and absorbing some of the vibration.  Carbon in conjunction with another composite will help reduce the "pink" sound quite a bit.
