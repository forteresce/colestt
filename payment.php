            I accept payment through the following:

                <li><b>Credit card</b> through <b>PayPal</b> (PayPal account not required)</li>
                <li><b>Personal checks</b> (for approved customers only)</li>

            USA Shipping
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I can send rubbers anywhere in the continental US via First Class for $1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bulky items like bags of balls, blades, glue, and post sets require $5 priority shipping, which takes two days to anywhere in the continental US.
                </li>
                <li>    
                    Both domestic options will include "delivery confirmation."
                </li>
            </ul>

            International Shipping
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I've shipped to every continent except Antarctica. I charge actual shipping for international orders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anything above 5oz has to go in a priority flat rate envelope, so if you're going to get more than one rubber, you might as well get 10 as far as shipping is concerned.
                </li>
                <li>    
                    Priority international has gone to $16.50. Above that it varies by weight, but will go priority which is trackable (actually just "deliver confirmation"). If the order won't fit in a flat rate envelope, it's best if you email me for a shipping quote.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I reserve the right to refuse any order (with full refund of course) due to shipping infeasibility or for any other reason I deem appropriate. Please <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> for more accurate quotes, especially if you're outside the US.
