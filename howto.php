			Anybody who plans on moving up from a pre-made 
			racket needs to know how to glue on a new sheet of rubbers and cut 
			it neatly to fit their blade. So here's some instructions on how I 
			do it.&nbsp; Personally I use the Zeropong scissors, but I know 
			others have more success with a scalpel or exacto knife.&nbsp; 
			Here's the steps I use:
	<ol>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Prime the rubber: </b>
			I'm a firm believer that rubber plays better with a few layers of 
			glue in the sponge.&nbsp; This is more critical with the firmer 
			Chinese sponges than with softer ones.&nbsp; If a sponge is under 
			40, I may just give it a couple layers for adhesion.&nbsp; If the 
			sponge is 40-43 I probably will give it 3-5 brushes full.&nbsp; If 
			it's over 43 I may give it as many as 6.&nbsp; Also if it's harder, 
			you may want to wrap it in plastic overnight and let that solvent 
			work on the sponge a little.&nbsp; Even if you don't continue to 
			speed glue, having expanded the sponge at least one time will make 
			it more lively.&nbsp; Any rubber cement is fine for this step. You 
			may want to trace where your blade will be to help you target where 
			to put your glue, if conservation is a goal.&nbsp; If you put a lot 
			of glue on the sponge, you want to let it dry back flat before 
			sticking it on.&nbsp; Otherwise it may shrink back down on the 
			blade. <b> Note - Speed glue is now illegal and regular rubber cement may also test positive for several days.  If you plan to go to a 
      sanctioned tournament within a week or so, I would suggest you use a water-based adhesive such as the voc-free glue on the accessories page of this site.</b><br>

			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Apply glue to face of 
			blade: </b>This doesn't have to be very thick.&nbsp; Let it tack dry 
			a couple of minutes before you stick it on.<br>

			</li>
			
			<li> 
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Lay the rubber on 
			evenly</b></p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Wet your scissors: </b>
			Critical step here.&nbsp; I use 409, but any soapy water or really 
			anything slick will do.&nbsp; Even water or spit is better than 
			nothing.&nbsp; It really will help keep the rubber from grabbing the 
			blade.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Open your scissors wide 
			and keep them that way: </b>Keep the rubber down in the power of the 
			scissors close to the pivot. You'll have to open them especially 
			wide to clear the flange at the start.&nbsp; It would seem like you 
			would want to make smooth long cuts following the blade, but that's 
			what you DON'T want to do.&nbsp; Make many tiny cuts of around 1mm 
			in length.&nbsp; They will actually show up less that way.&nbsp; Be 
			careful of hitting your blade.&nbsp; Take your time and keep the 
			scissors wet.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Repeat the process: </b>
			If you're doing both sides that is.<br>

            </p></li>
			
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>If using blade instead 
			of scissors: </b>I don't do this much, but the consensus seems to be 
			that if you use a blade, you need to make several passes.&nbsp; 
			Don't try to cut all the way through in one pass.</p></li>

    </ul>
	<ol>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Use good cement: </b>I 
			use best test one coat.&nbsp; Probably Elmer's would work.&nbsp; I 
			wouldn't try to use speed glue.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>Paint the sponge: </b>
			Rubber cement is contact cement, so you'll have to have glue on both 
			sponge and topsheet.&nbsp; Allow the sponge to dry flat before 
			putting on the topsheet.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>For pips, paint the 
			base sheet: </b>I know some long pips like Neubauer don't recommend 
			you paint the base sheet.&nbsp; This is because it tends to curl up 
			and then it's a mess.&nbsp; I personally do paint it, but if it's a 
			thin base sheet I will put a can on each corner to hold it down 
			until it's dried.&nbsp; You've got to be extremely careful not to 
			let the sheet fold over and touch itself on the glued side.&nbsp; If 
			you do its a disaster.&nbsp; It may take several minutes to dry back 
			flat.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; You don't want it to curl on you.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>For inverted, apply 
			glue to tips of pips: </b>This is the trickiest part of gluing an 
			inverted rubber.&nbsp; Personally, I save my plastic the sponge or 
			topsheet came in.&nbsp; Then I spread glue evenly across the 
			plastic.&nbsp; Finally, I lay the pips onto the plastic so that the 
			tips get glue on them.&nbsp; Then I peel it up and examine in the 
			light to make sure that they're all covered.&nbsp; If I missed areas 
			I may repeat the process.&nbsp; In fact, I usually do.&nbsp; Then 
			hold the sheet up and let the tips tack dry before you put it on the 
			sponge.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>For 
			pips - Putting on the topsheet: </b>I like to fold my pips in 
			the center BACKWARD so that it's easier to work with.&nbsp; Make 
			sure you fold it so that the pips are touching, not the glued base 
			sheet or you'll be sorry.&nbsp; When it's folded it's easier to work 
			with.&nbsp; Then lay the bottom edge down straight with the sponge.&nbsp; 
			I use a spray can as a roller to roll it down without getting 
			bubbles.&nbsp; If you do get bubbles, it may be easier to just pop 
			them with a needle than to try to peel it up and repeat the whole 
			process.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 200%"><b>For inverted - Putting 
			on the topsheet: </b>You can pretty much just lay the topsheet down 
			squarely onto the sponge.&nbsp; If you want to tension the topsheet, 
			you can roll it on with a can or whatever you use, kind of 
			stretching it as you go.&nbsp; Be careful, it's easy to 
			over-tension.&nbsp; You don't have to do much. Just rolling it on at 
			all will create some tension.</p></li>
