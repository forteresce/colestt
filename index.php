                well as reviews on them. Also, there are instructions on gluing and cutting rubber, and applying the

                For those of you who are "combination players," that is you use inverted on the forehand and some 
                type of "junk" rubber on the backhand, a good friend of mine is putting on an online clinic on the 
                techniques involved in that style of play.  If you're interested, check out this link:

                <b>And while we're thinking down under, here's one from top player William Henzell. The two time 
                Olympian has put on a table tennis coaching website at ttEDGE.com which features coaching

                I accept payment through the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>credit card</b> through <b>PayPal</b></li>
                    <li><b>personal checks</b> (for approved customers only)</li>
                </ul>
                NOTE: <u>You do NOT need to have a PayPal account</u> in order to pay by credit card through PayPal.

            <p>
                <b>International Shipping:</b> I have shipped to every continent except Antarctica.	I charge actual shipping for 
                international orders. NOTE: Shipping rates have changed. Now anything above 5oz has to go in a 
                priority flat rate envelope. So if you're going to get more than one rubber, you might as well get 10 as far 
                as shipping is concerned. Priority international has gone to $15. Above that it varies by weight but will go 
                priority which is trackable (actually just "deliver confirmation"). If the order won't fit in a flat rate envelope, 
                it's best if you email me for a shipping quote.
                <br /><br />

                I can send up to 2 rubbers anywhere in the continental US via First Class for $1. <b>Bulky items like bags 
                of balls, blades, and post sets are not available for $1 shipping. THE SHIPPING CHANGE IS MADE 
                ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE CART, AFTER YOU PUT IN YOUR INFO.</b>
                <br /><br />
            
                otherwise I use USPS Priority which is $5 and takes two days to anywhere in the continental US. 
                Both domestic options will include "delivery confirmation." I reserve the right to refuse any order (with full 
                refund of course) due to shipping infeasibility or for any other reason I deem appropriate.
                <br /><br />
