Here you'll find a selection of products for sale at great prices, as well as reviews on them. Also, there are instructions on gluing and cutting rubber, and applying the topsheet onto the sponge.		<b>Please read the shipping policy below before placing an order</b>.	</p>	<br />	<img src="images/picture.jpg"><br /><br /><br><br>	 <br> <b>For those of you who are "combination players," that is you use inverted on the forehand and some type of "junk" rubber on the backhand, a good friend of mine is putting on an online clinic on the techniques involved in that style of play.  If you're interested, check out this link:<a href = "http://www.gregsttpages.com/gttp/index.php/Online-Coaching-Program/gregs-online-table-tennis-coaching-program.html">Greg's Online Coaching Program</a></b><br><br>    <br> <b>And while we're thinking down under, here's one from top player William Henzell.    The two time Olympian has put on a table tennis coaching website at ttEDGE.com which features coaching videos,   match analysis, training exercises, blogs and more.

NOTE: Shipping rates have changed.  Now anything above 5oz has to go in a priority flat rate envelope. So if you're going to get more than one rubber, you might as well get 10 as far as shipping is concerned.  Priority international has gone to $15. Above that it varies by weight but will go priority which		is trackable (actually just "deliver confirmation"). If the order won't fit in a flat rate envelope, it's best if you email me for a shipping quote.<br><br>		    <p>I can send up to 2 rubbers anywhere in the continental US via First Class for $1.  <b>Bulky items like bags of balls, blades, and post sets are not available for $1 shipping.   THE SHIPPING CHANGE IS MADE ON THE SECOND    PAGE OF THE CART, AFTER YOU PUT IN YOUR INFO.</b>		    <p>Otherwise I use USPS Priority which is $5 and takes two days to anywhere in the continental US.  Both domestic		options will include "delivery confirmation."  I reserve the right to refuse any order (with full refund of course)due to shipping infeasibility or for any other reason I deem appropriate.		<br /><br />				<a href="contact.php">Contact me</a> for more accurate quotes, especially if you're outside the US.	</p>		<h2>Links:</h2>  <p>    <ul>      <li><a href="http://www.dawei-inspirit.com">Dawei Inspirit - www.dawei-inspirit.com</a></li>      <li><a href="http://www.dawei-inspirit-quattro.com">Dawei Inspirit Quattro - www.dawei-inspirit-quattro.com</a></li>      <li><a href="http://www.dawei-genote-blades.com">Dawei Genote Blades - www.dawei-genote-blades.com</a></li>    </ul>  </p>
